##Things to do (list of future implementations)
~~a) when viewed on a tablet all you can see is the top of the girl's head.~~  
**FIXED:**Had to remove the picture of the girl in order to guarantee this won't happen.

~~b) Under "help tree" this button should open a screen entitled, "Warning Signs of Suicide" and include the warning signs from the following URL:   
<https://afsp.org/about-suicide/risk-factors-and-warning-signs/>~~  
**FIXED:** Need to fix CSS formatting.

~~At the bottom of this screen, we'd like a button that says "Ask the Question" on the "Ask the Question" screen, please include the following:~~  
~~1. Are you having any thoughts of suicide?~~  
~~2. You seem pretty down/discouraged. Have you ever had thoughts about ending your life?~~  
**FIXED:** Added.

~~c) Please add a button on the home screen that says "Get Involved" that links to our Facebook and Twitter feeds, as well as the organization pages (on siue collegiatelink) for the following:~~  

~~**College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists**~~  
~~**Active Minds**~~  
~~**MISSA**~~  

~~d) Please add the Crisis Text Line under important contacts (Text START to 741741)~~  
**FIXED:** The phone's SMS app doesn't open, like it does for the phone numbers, but there isn't any easy way to fix this.

e) Under Get Educated please link to Kognito page on Counseling Services website

~~g) Under "Important Contacts" move the crisis numbers up above "Provident Counseling" and push everything else down.~~  
**FIXED**

~~h) Please put the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800.273.8255) at the bottom of the screen on the home page.~~  
**FIXED**
